                            <p>Children are incredibly important to the Adventist Church and the Adventist Church does everything possible to promote their wellbeing and development. The Children’s Ministries Department develops relevant age-appropriate resources to share the Bible with children from birth to the age of fourteen. As they learn from the Bible, children are often the first to embrace the love of Jesus and want to share it with others. The Children’s Ministries Department helps nurture the spiritual growth of children and trains them as young leaders</p>

Family Ministries focuses on people in relationship. It is a ministry that provides tools to help individuals communicate more effectively, deepen commitment in marriage, and assist in becoming better parents.
